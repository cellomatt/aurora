**Sequelize** was used to store and easily manage data with its amazing 
data models and migrations.

**Express JS** was our framework and it reduced a ton of boiler plate 
code, freeing us to implement more features. 

**NPM** was our software registry, and within it we installed many packages;
some notable examples include:
* nodemon,
* morgan, 
* validator,
* *and more* 

**Pug** is an excellent view engine we used to quickly, yet still
beautifully display html on our pages.

**Heroku** is the web hosting app of our choice that allowed us to 
run our app on the cloud! 

**Honarable Mentions** are the developement tools that made life 
much more enjoyable! 
* Postman, made route testing very easy and fun!
* Postbird, its wonderful GUI made all the difference!


## Features that we implemented
Our team implemented many features throughout our fullstack app, these
are two in particular that ...
```
The big thing in our code that we implemented
```

## Challenges throughout the developement process
```
Code that gave us trouble
```
Originally this issue gave us much trouble as young naive devs, 


```
More error code
```
This bug certainly did not give us an easier time however
